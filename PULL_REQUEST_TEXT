# CI/CD on github-actions

This pull requests adds The Linux Foundation java
toolchain for CI/CD workflows on github-actions.

## Toolchain

The CI/CD workflows for this repository are triggered by the following:

* Pull Requests: Any pull request created will have 'maven install' run
  to build, test, and verify that the project can be installed to a
  local repository.
* Merges: The same workflow for Pull Requests is run but instead of
  installing to a local repository the build is saved as an artifact to GitHub.
* GitHub Releases: At any point the project can be packaged and released by
  creating a GitHub Release. This creates a maven artifact versioned to
  the specified tag of the release and upload it to none.


## Java Environment Variables

The following variables are available to workflows:
- `$MAVEN_RELEASE_REPO_URL`
   URL of the release repository
- `$MAVEN_RELEASE_REPO_USER`
   Username for the release repository
- `$MAVEN_RELEASE_REPO_PASS`
   Password for the release repository
